Windows System Deviation Rating Model

We define a deviation D as a measurable change in the system state from the default Windows configuration.

1. Notation and Definitions

Let S represent the system state, where:

S = {F, R, G, P, O}

F = Set of all system files  
R = Set of registry keys and values  
G = Group Policy settings  
P = Installed programs and drivers  
O = Other configurations (e.g., network settings, user preferences)  

Let S₀ be the default Windows system state.  
Let S' be the customized system state after user modifications.  

Define the deviation function:

D(S, S') = d(F) + d(R) + d(G) + d(P) + d(O)

where d(X) represents the deviation score for each system component.

2. Deviation Measurement  
Each system component is analyzed for deviations:

2.1 File System Deviations (d(F))  
Changes in system files include additions, deletions, and modifications. The deviation function is:

d(F) = ∑ (w_f ⋅ δ(F_i)), for i = 1 to n

where:  
- F_i is a file in the system,  
- δ(F_i) is an indicator function:  
  - δ(F_i) = 1, if F_i is modified, deleted, or added  
  - δ(F_i) = 0, otherwise  
- w_f is a weight assigned based on file importance (e.g., system files are weighted higher).  

2.2 Registry Deviations (d(R))  
Registry modifications affect system behavior and security:

d(R) = ∑ (w_r ⋅ δ(R_j)), for j = 1 to m

where:  
- R_j is a registry key or value,  
- δ(R_j) detects changes (similar to files),  
- w_r is a weight based on criticality.  

2.3 Group Policy Deviations (d(G))  
Group Policy settings are checked for deviations:

d(G) = ∑ (w_g ⋅ δ(G_k)), for k = 1 to p

where:  
- G_k is a Group Policy setting,  
- w_g is a weight based on security importance.  

2.4 Installed Programs and Drivers (d(P))  
The set of installed software and drivers is compared:

d(P) = ∑ (w_p ⋅ δ(P_l)), for l = 1 to q

where:  
- P_l represents an installed program or driver.  

2.5 Other Configurations (d(O))  
Network settings, user preferences, and security policies:

d(O) = ∑ (w_o ⋅ δ(O_m)), for m = 1 to r

3. Overall Deviation Score  
The total system deviation score is:

D(S, S') = d(F) + d(R) + d(G) + d(P) + d(O)

This score provides a Windows System Deviation Rating to quantify how far the system has changed from its default state.
