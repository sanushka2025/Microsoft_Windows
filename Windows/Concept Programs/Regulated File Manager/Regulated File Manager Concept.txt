The Regulated File Manager is a software tool designed to enhance file organization by managing and archiving files based on user-defined parameters. It aims to prevent excessive file clutter in storage locations by automatically sorting, limiting, and moving files according to specified rules. This approach ensures a cleaner and more efficient file structure, reducing manual effort and optimizing storage usage. By implementing file size limits and age-based archiving, the software helps maintain an orderly system that minimizes storage inefficiencies.

One of the key features of the software is its ability to integrate with cloud storage solutions, such as AWS S3 or Google Cloud, allowing for automated archiving of older or less frequently accessed files. Users can configure the software to move certain file types or large files to remote storage, ensuring that local storage remains optimized without manual intervention. This makes it an ideal solution for users who need a regulated approach to file storage, whether for personal use or business file management.

The project can be implemented on a Raspberry Pi with SSD NVMe storage, making it a cost-effective and energy-efficient solution for file management. By using an NVMe SSD via a USB adapter or an expansion board, the Raspberry Pi can handle large amounts of data with significantly improved read/write speeds. This setup allows users to run the Regulated File Manager as a lightweight, dedicated server for organizing and archiving files locally or in the cloud. The Piâ€™s low power consumption and compact size make it an excellent choice for small-scale automated storage solutions.

With proper configuration, the software can be scheduled to run automatically via cron jobs on Linux or Task Scheduler on Windows, ensuring continuous file regulation. It provides flexibility by allowing users to define storage rules that suit their needs, such as setting limits on folder sizes or enforcing archival policies for outdated files. Whether used for personal storage management, business document organization, or server file regulation, the Regulated File Manager offers a structured and efficient approach to maintaining digital storage environments.
